# Python


A very very basic Python3 network script that finds site's IP, pings and traceroutes.

Consider this:
If you want to tcptraceroute, you have to be a superuser as root in Linux.
The script hasn't run in Windows and MacOS yet. 

## Dependicies

* traceroute 2.1.0-1
* ping 20161105.1f2bb12-2

## Usage

    cd ~ 
    git clone https://github.com/miador/IP_Finder 
    cd IP_Finder
    python3 IP_Finder.py

I want to see your feedbacks/commits for my first script.

Good luck!
